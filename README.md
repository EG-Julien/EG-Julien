# Hi, I’m Julien
I’m a 23 years old boy who just go his diploma as embedded electronic system engineer. I'm currently creating a startup `Kariboo` wich design drones payload for a universal drone structure.
I'm explaining some of my project on my [blog](https://blog.kariboo.cc) and you can learn more about my company on [it website](https://kariboo.cc).
